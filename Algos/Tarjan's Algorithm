To find bridges, condition is the low time of prev unvisited neighbour > curr node's discovery time, then edge from u to v is a bridge as v cannot reach an 
ancestor node of curr node.

To find articulation points, 2 cases:

  if its a root node, it should have atleast 2 independent children(keep a child count of unvisited nodes during dfs)
  if not not a root node,
      only if the low time of the previously unvisited neighbour was >= curr node's discovery time, then its an articulation point

class Solution:
    def criticalConnections(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        
        adj_list = collections.defaultdict(list)
        
        for server1, server2 in connections:
          adj_list[server1].append(server2)
          adj_list[server2].append(server1)
          
        critical_connections = []

        time = 0
        times = {}
        
        def dfs(curr, parent):
          nonlocal critical_connections, time

          times[curr] = [time, time]
          time += 1
          
          for neighbour in adj_list[curr]:
            if neighbour == parent:
              continue
            #back edge
            elif neighbour in times:
              times[curr][1] = min(times[curr][1], times[neighbour][1])
            #totally unvisited neighbour
            else:
              dfs(neighbour, curr)
              #low time of unvisited neighbour > curr discovery time indicates that if current edge is removed, there is no link from neigbour to a ancestor of curr node, so its a critical edge
              if times[neighbour][1] > times[curr][0]:
                critical_connections.append([curr, neighbour])
              else:
                times[curr][1] = min(times[curr][1], times[neighbour][1])
        
        dfs(0, None)
        return critical_connections
