#Time an space are both O(1)
#Find degrees of both hour and mins and diff them both and then find the min of diff, (360 - diff)

class Solution:
    def angleClock(self, hour: int, minutes: int) -> float:

        hour_degrees = ((hour % 12) + (minutes/60))*30
        minutes_degrees = minutes * 6
        
        diff = abs(hour_degrees - minutes_degrees)
        diff = min(diff, 360 - diff)
        return diff
